# pushin-🅿️

You can use pushin-🅿️ [here](https://yayabosh.github.io/pushin-P/)!

Inspired by Gunna's phrase "[Pushin 🅿️](https://twitter.com/1GunnaGunna/status/1479294831381811205?s=20)", this app lexes an input string and outputs a 🅿️-ified version. I'm not sure what "Pushin 🅿️" means and I don't know if Gunna does either, but it has definitely caught on and I was bored during cse 333 lecture so why not. 🅿️hank you for 🅿️eading
